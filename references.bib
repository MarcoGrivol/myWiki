abstract = {This paper tries to give a gentle introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, proceeding from theoretical foundations to applications. We first discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including several major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the fundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some fundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the reasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously medical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected by this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image segmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also recent trends in physical simulation, modeling, and reconstruction that have led to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior knowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These apparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep ()learning. However, we also briefly discuss promising approaches that might be able to resolve these problems in the future.}

abstract = {Objective
This retrospective and exploratory study tested the accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) at detecting Alzheimer’s disease patients with dementia (ADD) based on input variables extracted from resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) or both.
Methods
For the classification exercise, the ANNs had two architectures that included stacked (autoencoding) hidden layers recreating input data in the output. The classification was based on LORETA source estimates from rsEEG activity recorded with 10–20 montage system (19 electrodes) and standard sMRI variables in 89 ADD and 45 healthy control participants taken from a national database.
Results
The ANN with stacked autoencoders and a deep leaning model representing both ADD and control participants showed classification accuracies in discriminating them of 80%, 85%, and 89% using rsEEG, sMRI, and rsEEG + sMRI features, respectively. The two ANNs with stacked autoencoders and a deep leaning model specialized for either ADD or control participants showed classification accuracies of 77%, 83%, and 86% using the same input features.
Conclusions
The two architectures of ANNs using stacked (autoencoding) hidden layers consistently reached moderate to high accuracy in the discrimination between ADD and healthy control participants as a function of the rsEEG and sMRI features employed.
Significance
The present results encourage future multi-centric, prospective and longitudinal cross-validation studies using high resolution EEG techniques and harmonized clinical procedures towards clinical applications of the present ANNs.}

abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is one of the famous causes of death among elderly. Diagnosis of this disease in the early stage is so difficult by conventional methods. Machine learning methods are one of the best choice for improving the accuracy and performance of diagnosis procedure. The heterogeneous dimensions and structure among the data of this disease have complicated the diagnosis process. Therefore proper features are needed to solve this complexity. In this research, proposed method is introduced in two main steps. In the first step, ensemble of pre-trained auto encoder based feature extraction modules are used to generate image feature from 3D input image and in the second step convolutional neural network is used to diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease. Three different classification cases, namely; Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) versus Normal Condition (NC), AD versus Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and MCI versus NC are studied. Obtained results show that accuracy rate for AD/NC, AD/MCI and MCI/NC are 95%, 90% and 92.5%, respectively. Also, for all cases sensitivity and specially sensitivity rates for proposed method confirm that it could be reliable for diagnosis AD in early stage and has less error to detect normal condition.}

  abstractNote = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) weighs heavily on health expenditure and is strongly associated with increasing age. Due to population aging,  increasing global prevalence of AD will pose huge challenges to public health and elderly care systems in all countries across the world. Objectives: This study aimed to better understand the burden of AD from a healthcare perspective. Methods: A systematic literature review of journal articles published between January 2002 and December 2012 was performed for studies conducted in France,  Germany,  Italy,  The Netherlands,  Spain,  the United Kingdom (UK),  and the United States of America (USA),  using Medline,  Embase,  and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database. Results: 3, 288 references were initially retrieved,  and 39 epidemiological and 66 economic publications were selected for data extraction. AD incidence rates greatly varied between countries; however,  prevalence was more consistent across all included countries,  ranging between 3–7%. Overall,  medical costs were lower in France compared to other included countries and increased with AD severity,  e.g.,  direct medical costs per year for mild AD ranged from 5, 476 int$ in France to 27, 380 int$ in Spain. Limitations,  such as heterogeneous methodology and missing data,  prevented the comparison of results across studies between countries or the conclusion of any trend over time. Conclusion: This review corroborates previous understanding that AD burden is high for both society and healthcare providers. Limitations regarding study heterogeneity restricted conclusions; further research is required. Stakeholders could benefit from new healthcare strategies addressing both epidemiological and economic aspects of AD.},
